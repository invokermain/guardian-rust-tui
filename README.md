# Guardian TUI 🛡️
## Introduction 👋
A Text User Interface (TUI) that lets you read the Guardian, something that no one ever wanted! In reality this was a first project to try and learn the basics of rust.

Built on top of two cool libraries :star:
- [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)
- [alethia](https://github.com/MarSavar/aletheia)

## Features 🚀
- 8 hardcoded sections of the news. 💪
- No pesky formatting on the story, instead just an easy to digest single blob of text. 💯
- Three different themes to keep things feeling fresh. 🎨

## Themes 🖌️
